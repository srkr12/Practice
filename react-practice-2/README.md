## Contact Page

This project is a React-based contact page designed to collect user information through a form. It features a modular component structure, allowing for better code organization and reusability. The form includes validation logic implemented using regex patterns for name and email fields, ensuring that user input meets specific criteria. The useState() hook is used to manage form data and trigger error messages when validation fails.

Key Features:

Component-based architecture for better code management.
Form elements with real-time error messages.
Regex validation for name and email fields.
State management using useState() for dynamic form handling.
